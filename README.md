**Project Description:**
This project, completed as part of a take-home assignment for the Detroit Lions, involves the development of Python scripts and SQL queries for data manipulation and analysis. I created the fetcher to fetch data from a random api and I stored that data in a data base & made 5 interesting queries in SQL about the 200 people from that random API. Then i converted my json file to big query on google cloud.

**Python Script:**
- **fetch_api_data:** A script is provided to fetch data from a random API and store it in a JSON file.
- **create_json:** Converts fetched data into a JSON string for improved readability.
- **write_json_to_file:** Writes JSON content to a file.

**SQL Queries:**
- **CREATE TABLE:** Defines 'data_users' and 'MulticulturalData' tables for storing fetched data.
- **Data Analysis Queries:** Extract insights from user data.

**Google Cloud Upload:**
The JSON file generated by the script is uploaded to Google Cloud's BigQuery for further analysis and scalability.
